## Coronary Artery Disease Prediction

## *Please note that some of the exploratory data analysis is dependent upon on Allen Downey's textbook and code from ThinkStats2.

The dataset I chose for this capstone project in the course of Data Exploration and Analysis was examining a Heart Disease dataset from the University of California-Irvine Machine Learning repository.  The data is conglomerated from 4 different data sources from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and a VA Facility in Long Beach, California.

Coronary Artery disease is typically defined as atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries.  In layman's term, heart disease is due to build up of cholesterol in the inside of arteries.  There are several risk factors for CAD including high blood pressure, excessive weight, smoking, gender, genders, and baseline cholesterol levels.

Even with appropriate screening, CAD can be silent until a cardiac event such as a Myocardial Infarction or Heart Attack.

The purpose of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset as well as attempt to use a machine learning algorithm to see if diagnosed coronary artery disease could be predicted reliably from a machine learning algorithm.
